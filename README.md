# 🎓 Student Performance Predictor

This project is a machine learning-based web application that predicts a student's exam **percentage** based on:
- 📌 Attendance (%)
- 🧠 IQ Level
- ⏰ Study Hours per Day

The model was trained using real student data and deployed as an interactive Gradio app.

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Load Dataset**: Cleans and prepares student records
2. **Train Model**: Uses Linear Regression to learn from:
   - Attendance
   - IQ Level
   - Study Hours
3. **Predict Output**: Returns a predicted percentage when user provides inputs
